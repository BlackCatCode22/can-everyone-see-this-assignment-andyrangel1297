1.4 - Varable Assignment and Initialization

vocabulary 
    assignment - the process in which a varable has been given a value
    assignment operator - "="
    copy assignment - when value on right-hand side of the "=" is given to variable of left-hand side
    initialization - when a variable is defined and assigned value at the same time
    initializer - value used to initialize a variable 
    default initialization - when no initialization value is provided (usually an indeterminate value)
    copy initialization - when an initializer is provided after an equals sign 
        (ex. int width = 5;)
    direct initialization - when an initializer is provided inside a parenthesis
        (ex. int width (5))
    list initialization - modern way to initialize objects in C++ by using curly braces
        also known as uniform initialization and brace intitialization
        (ex. int width {5};     or      ex. int height = {6};       or      ex. int depth {};)
    value initialization - when a variable is list initialized using empty braces
        - in most cases, initialized variable to zero called zero initialization
