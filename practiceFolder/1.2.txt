1.2 - Comments

vocabulary
comment - a programmer-readable note that is inserted directly into the source code of the program
commenting out - converting one or more lines of code into a comment

- // begins a C++ single-line comment
- it tells compiler to ignore everything from // symbol to end of line

- it's typically used to make quick comment about single line of code
- if lines are fairly short, comments can be aligned using tab
- long lines usually have single-line comments placed on top

- /* */ pair denotes a C-style multi-line comment
- everything in between symbols is ignored

Three Things Comments are Typically Used for
    1) comments are used to describe what the library, program, or function does and are typically
    placed at the top

    2) comments are used within a library, program, or function to describe how the code is going to
    accomplish its goal

    3) comments are used to describe why the code is doing something
        - comments are great way to remind yourself or others the reason you made one decision instead
        of another
    
- commenting out code is a convenient way to temporarily exclude parts of code from being compiled in
program
